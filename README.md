The goal of this project is to create a template for full stack web development
using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) as the backend framework and
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) as the frontend framework

See [Confluence Page](https://princhcanal.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NNT/overview) for instructions on how to run the app as well as other documentation
